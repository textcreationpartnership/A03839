         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Looke how the minde of Man, in the day is exerciſed, ſo commonly his braine and his phantaſie in the night is buſied.

            <p>Thirdly, the Saints of God are too often too forgetfull of the Lords former mercies, and care of them.

            </p>
            <p>Theſe three things, firſt, the ſeeming impoſſibilitie of the deliuerance to bee performed, and mans ignorance of Gods power to effect it; and withall our forgetfulneſſe of the Lords former mercies ſo often manifeſted, doe cauſe this aſtoniſhment and amazement in vs: yea, diſtruſt and doubtfulneſſe, when beyond our expectation ſuch things come to paſſe; as here, the Iewes being ſo long detayned captiues vnder ſo fierce &amp; furious a Nation, they thought it a thing impoſſible to bee ſet at libertie; withall, being either ignorant of Gods ſufficiency, or forgetfull of his former clemency, they expected nothing leſſe then their deliuerie; and therefore, when they were indeed deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, they were doubtfull and amazed, <hi>like vnto them that dreame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But let not vs in our greateſt extremities doubt of Gods mercies: and albeit our caſe, to our thinking, be neuer ſo deſperate, yet let vs not be diſtruſtfull of the Lords pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; for though <hi>Ezekiah</hi> expect nothing but<note n="h" place="margin">
                  <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.</note> death; though <hi>Ionah</hi> be wearie of his<note n="i" place="margin">

For hee could bring them againe from the Eaſt countrie, and from the Weſt, and cauſe them to dwell in the midſt of<note n="l" place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>Let vs auoid theſe two inconueniences, ignorance and incredulitie. For <hi>Sarah</hi> being ignorant of Gods power,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:14515:20"/>when the Lord promiſed her a ſonne,<note n="l" place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.</note> ſhee laughed, for which ſhee was ſharply reproued, and rebuked of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell: and the young Captayne being diſtruſtfull of Gods ſufficiencie to ſuccour hispeople in the great famine, was trodden to death in the Gates of<note n="m" place="margin">2. <hi>King.</hi> 7.22.</note> Samaria. Wherefore let vs not at any time be faithleſſe, but beleeue: for if we haue faith, all things are<note n="n" place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>Moreouer, this their wondring at their vnexpected de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerance, ſhould ſtill put vs in mind of our Redemption. Before the comming of our Sauiour,<note place="margin">☞</note> all mankind was cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuated, the Gentiles in Idolatrie, and the Iewes vnder the Law and Traditions. But at the comming of Chriſt, the Gentiles were freed from Idolatrie,<note place="margin">Plura apud S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Zacharias</hi> gaue no credit vnto the Angels words, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 20. and <hi>Mary</hi> her ſelfe ſaid, <hi>How ſhall this be? verſ.</hi> 34. and at his birth, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell did preach his natiuitie to the Shepheards, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they heard a multitude of heauenly Souldiers prayſing God for it; yet for their better aſſurance, they muſt goe &amp; ſee, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.15. and when they had ſcene it, they publiſhed it abroad, and all they that heard it, wondred: but, alas, too few beleeued it; they were ſo ſorgetfull, ſo ignorant,<note place="margin">Iſai and Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah.</note> and ſo incredulous, although the Prophets had ſet downe the certaintie, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 7.14. and 9.6. and <hi>Daniel</hi> had noted out the time, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.25, 26, 27. of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, yet were they <hi>like vnto them that dreame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, before I conclude this firſt ſequell, that follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vpon their deliuerance, <hi>viz.</hi> their coadmiration, their wondering, and meruailing at this their vnexpected free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, which made them <hi>like vnto men that dreame:</hi> I ſuppoſe, the curious Obſeruer of dreames ſuppoſeth, that I ſhould obſerue ſomewhat elſe of the lawfulneſſe, or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulneſſe of the obſeruation of dreames. I purpoſe not to wearie the godly eare, in relating the curious and fond
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:14515:20"/>coniectures of the idle Expoſitors of dreames, onely this which is not very diſſonant from this place, but rather ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to bee implyed in the words. For whilſt the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt ſheweth the peoples incredulitie, by comparing them to ſuch as dreame: he doth couertly taxe the vanitie and deceitfulneſſe of dreames. So that I ſay, we may conclude,<note place="margin">The obſeruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of dreames vnlawfull, and why.</note> that it is abſolutely vnlawfull to bee too curious an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruer of dreames. For firſt, they are forbidden; <hi>You ſhall not ſoothſay, nor obſerue dreames.</hi> Secondly, they are in themſelues vaine and idle. <hi>Where there are many dreames, there are many vanities.</hi> Thirdly, they are deceitfull and erroneous, <hi>for dreames haue cauſed many to erre.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But thou wilt ſay,<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> are not diuine dreames lawfull and laudable?</p>
            <p>Yes truely, they were to be receiued and beleeued,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> but now there are none ſuch, or they are not frequent nor vſuall.</p>
            <p>How then (wilt thou ſay) doe I vnderſtand that place of <hi>Ioel? I will powre out my Spirit vpon all fleſh,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Octiect.</note>

            </p>
            <p>I vnderſtand it as the Apoſtle expounds it, that by theſe words are meant the gifts and graces of Gods Spirit, which vnder the Goſpell ſhould be giuen to the Church in greater abundance, then in times paſt; and whereas in old times they had dreames and viſions; ſo vnder Chriſt, they ſhould haue cleare reuelations; and this was verified, when on the day of Pentecoſt, the holy Ghoſt deſcended in the viſible forme of fiery clouen tongues, and ſate vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Apoſtles, and when the Houſe was filled with an audible ſound from heauen, as of a mightie ruſhing wind: whereupon the Apoſtles were all filled with the holy Ghoſt, and began to ſpeake with other tongues, as the Spirit gaue them<note n="t" place="margin">

            <p>Againe, if you take that place of <hi>Ioel</hi> literally, yet was it fulfilled in the time of the Apoſtles. When the Lord

            <p>The obſcruation which I gather from this place, is once againe to vſe the words of <hi>Salomon,</hi> that <hi>to all things there is an appointed time: a time to weepe, and a time to laugh, a time to mourne, and a time to dance.</hi> It is reported of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raclytus,</hi> that hee was euer weeping: and of <hi>Democritus,</hi> that hee was euer laughing.

As for example, the Iſraelites when they were oppreſſed with the intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable crueltie of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and the Taske-maſters, they had a time of mourning. But when they were deliuered from his tyrannie, and ſaw their enemies ouer whelmed horſe and horſemen in the ſea, they found a time for<note n="k" place="margin">

For, <hi>the hope of the ungodly is like duſt that is blowne away with the wind, like a thinne froth that is driuen away with the ſtorme, and like ſmoke that is diſperſed heere and there with a</hi>

               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:14515:24"/>did: yet, if hee fall but into any little ſickneſſe, his riches affoord him no eaſe. If a man be honorable, yet fall into pouertie, what comfort or reliefe ſhall hee haue from his honour? Yea, grant that hee bee rich, honourable, and healthfull: yet will the leaſt misfortune or croſſe trouble and grieue him, as if hee were of all men moſt miſerable. <hi>Haman</hi> called his friends, and <hi>Zereſh</hi> his wife, and told them of the glorie of his riches, and how the King had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanced him aboue all his Princes and Seruants: yea, and how, hee onely was admitted vnto the Queenes banquet: yet all this auailed him nothing: his health, riches, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and the Kings fauour, could not <hi>fill his mouth with laughter,</hi> when hee remembred how <hi>Mordecai</hi> did not bow the knee, nor reuerenced<note n="p" place="margin">

When the King of Iericho heard, how the Lord had dried vp the waters of the red Sea before the Iſraelites: and what a glorious victorie hee had giuen them, of the two Kings of the Ammorites: hee and all the inhabitants of the land were ſore amazed, they were greatly affrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, their heart fainted, and their courage was<note n="i" place="margin">

            <p>Thus, the Lord will deliuer his owne children. Firſt, to manifeſt his power and glorie, that the Gentiles may know, that hee is the God of ſaluation.

If it were in nothing, but in him they liue, moue, and haue their being; and in that he cauſeth the raine to fall vpon them, as well as vpon his owne children; and maketh the Sunne to ſhine, as well vpon them as vpon the righteous, they are much bound to ſo prouident a God, yet ſuch is their ignorance that they

            <p>The ſecond generall obſeruation, is this, ſeeing they if<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme what the Heathen did auerre: yea, and publikely profeſſe and confeſſe the ſame: wee learne, that it is not enough for vs to praiſe God priuately for his memorable workes, and for our ſelues to be mindfull of his benefits, but withall, we ſhould publiſh and diuulge the ſame.

            </p>
            <p>The publiſhing of Gods workes ſerues, firſt, to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the hearers thereof in the faith: yea, and ſo ſettle their affections in the true worſhip of God.

            </p>
            <p>Againe, it argues that wee are not aſhamed of our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and that we are not affrighted by the face of man, to ſet forth Gods prayſe, and to ſhew our vocation.

            </p>
            <p>Laſtly and chiefly, thereby wee giue glorie vnto God, and ſhew our thankfulneſſe. For this cauſe, the Man that was borne blind, did both glorifie God and manifeſt his thankfulneſſe; when ſo truely he related how he came to his ſight, ſo conſtantly ſtood in defence of Chriſts inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, and ſo boldly reprehended the Phariſies for their<note n="h" place="margin">

Yet neither mony nor malice, fauour nor feare of men, muſt make vs conceale Gods prayſe, or be ſilent from ſhe wing forth his wonderfull works. For if once we beleeue in our heart, we muſt confeſſe with our mouth. <hi>For with the heart men beleeue vnto righteouſneſſe, and with the mouth they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe vnto ſaluation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreouer, here is condemned the ſlothfull dulneſſe of men, who neuer enter into the conſideration of Gods works done vnto them; nor at any time acknowledge Gods goodneſſe and kindneſſe towards them. But, as the Prophet ſaith, <hi>The Harpe and Viol, the Timbrel and Pipe, are in their feasts, but they regard not the worke of the Lord, neither conſider the operation of his hands.</hi> And what is the cauſe of this? Is it not becauſe like the men of Iudah, who went into the Land of Egypt, they attribute all to the Queene of Heauen, and to their<note n="p" place="margin">

Whereas the Apoſtle ſaith, That euery good thing, and euery perfect gift comes from aboue, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth downe from the Father of<note n="q" place="margin">

            <p>The firſt thing in particular, that I promiſed,<note place="margin">Gods power implyed in his Name.</note> to obſerue in theſe words, was Gods power: and that firſt implyed in his Name, and ſet downe in his Worke.

They held it ineffable, not becauſe it could not be pronounced, but becauſe the ſignification of it could neuer fully be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. For ſome of the learned are of opinion, that the Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotencie, Wiſedome, and Eternitie of God, are all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed in this Name; of all the names of God, it was held in greateſt reuerence, ſo that ſeldome the Iewes did name it, but when the occaſion was weightie, and of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance; as when the Iſraelites were deliuered out of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, <hi>Moſes</hi> and the people began their ſong, <hi>The Lord is a man of warre, and Iehouah is his</hi>

            <p>Before our Sauiour was conceiued for our Redemption, he was named of the Angell, IESVS, in which bleſſed Name, ſome obſerue to bee included, the vowels called <hi>Tetragrammaton,</hi> with one <hi>S</hi> of the Hebrewes, wherein was a myſticall or hidden ſignification of his Diuinitie. But not to be too curious, let vs ſtill compare their deliuerance with our redemption, and ſee the Analogie betwixt theſe two names.</p>
            <p>Firſt, as the name <hi>Iehouah</hi> was not knowne to the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites,

            <p>The reparation of the Temple, and reformation of true Religion, was no little bleſſing wherewith God bleſſed them. <hi>Nebuchadonoſor</hi> was not content to rob the houſe of God of it treaſure, and to carrie out of it, all the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of gold and ſiluer; but withall, he brake downe the wall, and burnt it vp with<note n="h" place="margin">2. <hi>Clro.</hi> 36.</note> fire. And whereas before their laſt carrying away to Babylon, the Prieſt and the chiefe of the people, polluted the houſe of the Lord, with all the abominations of the Heathen: certainely, now when they had beene in long captiuitie, and great ſlauery, they did much accommodate themſelues to the cuſtome of the Chaldeans; ſo that there could not be but a great decay of the true worſhip and ſeruice of God. And if wee caſt our eyes to the 74. and 79. Pſalmes, wee ſhall ſee what patheticall lamentations, the godly powre out from the bitterneſſe of their ſoule, for the inſolencie of the Heathen ouer the Lords Heritage and Sanctuarie: we may there behold a wofull ſpectacle of deſolation: the Temple is defaced; the Synagogues of God deſtroyed; Gods Saints diſgraced, and pure Religion almoſt extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed and vtterly decayed.

Secondly, They giue diligent attention vnto him whileſt hee is reading. Thirdly, With all humiliation and reuerence they praiſe and worſhip the Lord.

Teaching vs to be much more glad for the Spirituall bleſſings, then for any temporall benefits wee receiued by the like deliuerance. Many were the bleſſings the Lord conferred vpon vs, when hee deliuered vs from that tragicall Conſpiracie: but theſe were the principall, the Church was not ſubuerted: our gracious Prince the Churches Head vnder Chriſt and his royall Progenie was not deſtroyed: nor the light of the Goſpell extinguiſhed.

            <p>The ſecond thing, wee obſerue in this Prayer is the Pſalmiſts pittie: for hee prayeth not for himſelfe alone, bur for all the afflicted members of the Church, teaching vs to doe the like for all our fellow-members in Chriſt

For, <hi>As many as I loue I rebuke and chaſtiſe, be zealous therefore and amend:</hi> ſayth Chriſt to the Angel of the Church of Laodicea. And wee ought to let the patient know, that afflictions are the harbengers, that goe before death, and therefore they ſhould daily prepare them for their end: as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> wiſhed <hi>Ezekiah</hi> to put his houſe in order, for hee ſhould die<note n="q" place="margin">
                  <hi>Iſ.</hi> 38.1.</note> and not liue.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, wee ought to pray for them. When <hi>Myriam</hi> was ſtricken with a fearefull leproſie, <hi>Moſes</hi> prayed for her. When the peſtilence was amongſt the Iſraelites, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> mourned, and prayed for<note n="ſ" place="margin">2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.</note> them. When <hi>Peter</hi> was captiuated and impriſoned by <hi>Herod,</hi> prayer was made without ceaſing of the Church vnto God for<note n="t" place="margin">
                  <hi>Act.</hi> 12.5.</note> him. When <hi>Nehemiah</hi> was told of the afflictions and reproches of his countrymen the Iewes, he weepes, mournes, faſts, and<note n="u" place="margin">
                  <hi>Neb.</hi> 1.</note> prayes. And <hi>Daniel</hi> knowing that the time of their cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuitie
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:14515:60"/>was expired: and conſidering the great miſerie wherein they were detained, hee did feruently call vnto God to diuert away his wrath from<note n="x" place="margin">
                  <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.1. to the 20.</note> them: as you may ſee pathetically expreſſed in the ninth of his Prophecie. And truly this is a difference betwixt the godly and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly: The godly pray both for themſelues and others, as did <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Ezekiah</hi> and others. But the wicked they are ſo farre from praying for others, that they haue not ſo much grace as to pray for themſelues: but like <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Magus</hi> deſire <hi>Peter,</hi> and like <hi>Pharaoh</hi> require <hi>Moſes,</hi> and like <hi>Ieroboam</hi> intreat the young Prophet to pray for them. But the Pſalmiſt here hath both grace to pray for himſelfe, and charitie to pray for the whole Church, and therefore hee ſayth:</p>
            <q>O Lord bring againe our captiuitie.</q>
            <p>The ſubſtance of this prayer is the conuerſion of their captiuitie. The word <hi>Captiuitie,</hi> ſayth <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> is ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in pronunciation,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Nomen captiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis eſt in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latione ſimplex, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>in loc.</hi>
               </note> and yet it hath many ſignifications: but Captiuitie properly is when one Nation is made ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect vnto another: as when the Iewes were wholly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued by the Babylonians, their Princes, and thouſands of them carried to Babel: they are ſaid, to <hi>be carried away captiues out of their owne Land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, the afflictions and troubles of Gods children, are called by the name of captiuitie. Becauſe there is no eſtate ſo lamentable in the world as is the eſtate of a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue: and therefore the moſt grieuous croſſes that can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall Man, are expreſſed in one word Captiuitie. Infinite were the ſufferings of <hi>Iob,</hi> when his goods were taken away by violence, his children ſuddenly deſtroyed, and himſelfe ſtricken with ſore byles, from the ſole of his foot to his crowne. Yet all theſe and many moe are inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in this one word: for when the Lord reſtored him to his former health, doubled his eſtate, and bleſſed him with the goodlleſt children in the world, hee is ſaid, <hi>To turne againe the captiuitie of</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">
                  <hi>Iob.</hi> 42.10.</note>

            <pb n="115" facs="tcp:14515:60"/>
            <p>In both theſe reſpects, the Pſalmiſt here doth powre out this prayer, <hi>O Lord bring againe our captiuitie:</hi> deſiring God therein both to enlarge the Churches libertie, and withall to eaſe and releaſe them of all their calamities.

If wee bee afflicted in ſoule as was <hi>Hannah;</hi> or ſicke in bodie with <hi>Ezekiah.</hi> If wee bee brought with <hi>Iob</hi> to ſit, full of ſore byles on the aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heape: or be conſtrained to lie with <hi>Lazarus</hi> at the glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous gate full of ſores: heere is the onely remedie for our maladie, to call vnto the Lord with the Iewes: <hi>O Lord bring againe our captiuitie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, theſe captuities are but corporall afflictions: but beſides there is ſpiritual captiuities of the ſoule and mind.

So muſt the faithfull ſoule pull vp all the thiſtles and thornes out of his heart: hee muſt roote out all the tares of vice and wickedneſſe, or elſe hee labours in vaine: for they will choke and ouergrow the good feed of repentance, ſo that he cannot <hi>ſowe in teares.</hi>

            <p>Thirdly, Raine is requiſite to the Sower for the moiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and mollifying of his<note n="p" place="margin">

            <p>The occaſions of the godlies ſorrow are infinite: ſome ſorrow for the preſent miſerie they ſuſtaine, whileſt they ſoiourne in this wretched world: as <hi>Dauid</hi> did mourne that he dwelt in Meſech, &amp; remained in the tents<note n="t" place="margin">

Teares are the riuer of Paradiſe, to wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the earth of our hearts. Teares are the poole of Siloam, where the eyes of our ſoules muſt be waſhed. In a word, if wee truely waſh our ſelues in a flood of teares, we ſhall bee throughly purged from our ſinnes, and fully cleanſed from our filth. <hi>Marie Magdalen</hi> did not ſo much waſh with teares our Sauiours ſpotleſſe feet, as ſhee did her owne leaprous ſoule: her teares made her crimſon ſinnes <hi>white as ſnow;</hi> and her ſcarlet ſoule <hi>white as wooll.</hi> Thus wee ſee how neceſſarie and expedient it is for vs all to <hi>ſow in teares.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, as for the commoditie and profit wee ſhall reape after this ſorrow, <hi>Wee ſhall reape in ioy,</hi> wee ſhall haue remiſſion of our ſinnes, and true conſolation, and all out ward content and in ward peace. And for our bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter aſſurance, amougſt many preſidents, let vs cull out one. In the Parable of the prodigall Child, wee ſee, how that vnthrift, when hee riotouſly ſpent and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted his portion, hee was brought from beeing a gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant, to become a ſwineheard, and from filling his belly with dainties, to feede vpon huskes, and ſo being
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:14515:69"/>almoſt famiſhed, hee reſolued to returne to his father and acknowledging his offence, to craue pardon, and to beg his fauour to entertayne him for one of his hyred ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants: But marke the loue and compaſſion of a louing fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he ſees him a-farre off, falls vpon his neck, and kiſſes him, not with a naturall kiſſe, as <hi>Raguel</hi> did his daughter; nor with a treacherous kiffe, as <hi>Iudas</hi> did our Sauiour; nor with a holy kiſſe onely, as the Saints ſaluted one another, but with a true loue kiſſe, as <hi>Iacob</hi> did <hi>Ioſeph:</hi> then he cals out his ſeruants, not to murther him, as <hi>Abſalom</hi> charged his men to kill <hi>Ammon,</hi> but to embrace and welcome him: next, he commands him to bee apparelled, <hi>vestitu Regio,</hi> with robes Royall, as <hi>Ahaſhueroſh</hi> commanded <hi>Morde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cai</hi> to bee arrayed. Fourthly, hee puts a Ring vpon his hand, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did his Signet vpon <hi>Ioſephs</hi> finger. Fift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, hee muſt bee feaſted, as <hi>Abraham</hi> enterteyned the Angels, <hi>vitulo optimo &amp; ſaginato,</hi> with the beſt and fatteſt Calfe.

            <p>We are all prodigal children, we haue abuſed and miſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpent, and waſted our goods; but if once with vnfayned teares, wee turne home to our louing Father, hee will fall vpon our necke, and kiſſe vs more tenderly then euer <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> did <hi>Abſalom:</hi> He will charge his Angels to wait and attend vpou<note n="f" place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>The firſt of theſe expoſitions is not much diſſonant from the purpoſe: and the ſecond is very conſonant with the words: yet there is a third,<note place="margin">Conſule Fabri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium, in bune locum.</note> which is the moſt generall and moſt receiued conſtruction of this place, that is, by this figuratiue phraſe, and allegoricall kind of ſpeech, is meant,<note place="margin">The afflicted Chriſtian compared to a ſower, for three reſpects.</note> that all the afflictions, troubles, and tribulations of the godly ſhall haue an end: and in the appointed time ſhall be finiſhed. Now our afflictions are ſhadowed out by ſowing, and the eſtate of a Chriſtian is reſembled to a Husbandman.</p>
            <p>Firſt, For the antiquitie of that Calling. <hi>Adam</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:14515:70"/>our great grand-father, was of that vocation: ſo was hee the firſt that ſuffered affliction. Hee was exiled out of Paradiſe; he got his liuing with the ſweat of his browes; he did eate his bread with ſorrow; he ſaw his wife bring forth with paine and griefe. <hi>Abel</hi> murthered, <hi>Cain</hi> cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and <hi>Lamech</hi> in all villanie, prophane and wicked.</p>
            <p>Secondly, For the vniuerſalitie of that Calling,<note place="margin">2.</note> all ſorts of people haue beene of it. <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> was taken from the plow, and made the ſecond King of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans. <hi>Lucnllus,</hi> Queſtor and Pretor, was much delighted in gardning; and <hi>Cyrus</hi> himſelfe, the great Monarch of the Eaſt, was much addicted to planting. But to leaue theſe: <hi>Eliſha</hi> the Prophet was called from the Plow: <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deon</hi> the iudge, brought from the threſhing floore; and <hi>Saul</hi> the King, from ſeeking his fathers Aſſes: ſo afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are common to all degrees and ſorts of men. <hi>Eliah</hi> the Prophet was perſecuted by <hi>Iezabel. Zachariah</hi> the Prieſt murthered betwixt the Temple and the Altar. <hi>Samſon</hi> the iudge had his eyes put out, and was mockt of the Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimes: and <hi>Ezekia</hi> the King, had all his bones broken like a Lion.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, For the great commoditie and gayne that the Husband-man reapes by that Calling: as for example.<note place="margin">3.</note> 
               <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaak,</hi> who hauing ſowed in the Land of Gerar, within the ſpace of one yeare, reapt a hundred<note n="ſ" place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 26.</note> fold: So the faithfull ſhall reape double for their afflictions, witneſſe <hi>Iob,</hi> whoſe afflictions were many, and loſſes great: yet we ſee the Lord reſtored to him a thouſand for fiue hundred, fourteene for ſeuen, and ſixe for<note n="t" place="margin">
                  <hi>Iob</hi> 42.</note> three. Now ſeeing this latter conſtruction is moſt generally receiued, as the moſt genuine meaning of this place. In handling this point of afflictions, I will note out; firſt, the certaintie of them. WE muſt all <hi>ſowe in teares.</hi> Secondly, the neceſſitie of them, NONE <hi>ſhall reape in ioy,</hi> but ſuch as HAVE <hi>ſowne in teares.</hi> And thirdly, the vtilitie of them, WHOSOE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VER <hi>ſoweth in teares, ſhall reape in ioy.</hi>

If all men ſhould reape in ioy, then of all men were the wicked moſt happy; if they ſhould both liue at eaſe in this world, and reape ioy in the world to come. No; but there is no ſuch matter. For <hi>woe be vnto them that are at eaſe in Sion: woe be vnto them that are rich, for they haue receiued their conſolation: woe be vnto them that are full, for they ſhall hunger:</hi> All theſe haue a Harueſt by themſelues, and a Vintage of their owne; when the Angell ſhall thruſt in his ſickle, and cut them downe, and throw them into that vnquench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able flame, where they ſhall bee in torment for euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more. And therefore I conclude with the Philoſopher, there is none more vnhappy then hee that hath not taſted of aduerſitie.</p>

            <p>For your ſatisfaction, I referre you to the Goſpell, where wee read of one <hi>Simon</hi> of Cyrene, who carried Chriſts Croſſe.<note place="margin">☞</note> This <hi>Simon</hi> was a type of all obedient

            <p>Secondly, <hi>Simon</hi> beare the Croſſe after Chriſt, to ſhew vs that wee muſt not onely carrie it, but carrying of it, follow Chriſt.

            <p>Againe, a Chriſtian may learne here for his conſolation.

            </p>
            <p>Further, as <hi>Simon</hi> carried the Croſſe, but firſt Chriſt had borne it, for our comfort is, that Chriſt ſweetens all our afflictions, before they bee lay de vpon vs, and like a good Phyſician, hee ſtrowes the Pills thicke ouer with ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, before hee makes vs to ſwallow them.</p>

Secondly, a returning of man vnto God. Thirdly, a returning of God vnto himſelfe. Fourthly, a returning of God vnto man.</p>
            <p>Man is ſaid to returne to himſelfe, when bethinking himſelfe of his errours, and conſidering the wofull caſe he is in becauſe of his ſinne, hee reſolues with himſelfe to leaue his ſinne, and bewayling his former offences to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a new creature.

Both theſe wee ſee in the prodigall Child: firſt, hee conſiders with himſelfe in what wofull plight hee was in, by reaſon of his follie: and vpon this conſideration, hee reſolues to returne to his father to confeſſe his offence, and to begge pardon. Then, what hee purpoſed hee accordingly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed: hee returnes to his father, cries out, <hi>Father I haue ſinned against heauen and before thee, and am no more worthie to bee called thy</hi>

                  <hi>Iona</hi> 3.9. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30.5.</note> anger, and remembers his tender mercie, which endureth for euer: hee turnes from that which hee is not, to that which hee is: from that which hee hates, to that which hee loues: for hee retaineth not his wrath for euer, becauſe mercie plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth<note n="h" place="margin">

            <p>Hee returnes to man, when hee hath compaſſion vpon him, ſubdues his iniquities, and caſts all his ſinnes into the bottome of the ſea, and when hee reſtores him to his former happineſſe<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 80.14.</note> and eſtate. This is plainely ſeene in the pittifull father of the penitent prodigall: when hee ſees him afarre off what doth hee? Is his wrath remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred? Is his anger kindled? Is his ſonnes offence called to mind? No, no: there is nothing in the Father but loue and affection, mercie and compaſſion: hee runnes and meetes him, falls vpon his necke and kiſſes him, receiues him into his fauour, reſtores him into his former, nay bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him with a more happie eſtate then hee had before. In the precedent part of this Verſe is contained, the retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of man vnto God, by going on his way weeping, by his ſorrowing, and lamenting his ſinnes, and preſent miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie for ſinne. This latter part comprehends, the returning of God vnto man, in extending his mercie towards man, in cauſing him to returne with ioy, forgiuing his ſinne, and changing his wofull eſtate, into a ioyfull and glad eſtate. Theſe two muſt concurre together: <hi>Returne to mee, and I will returne to you,</hi> ſayth the Lord. For certaine it is, that hee that returnes to the Lord, by <hi>going on his way weeping:</hi> the Lord will returne to him, in cauſing him to <hi>returne with ioy, and bring his ſheaues with him.</hi> See <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 55.7.</p>

But when they were freed from thence, they marched towards Canaan with the noyſe of muſicke, with the ſound of Timbrels, dancing and reioycing. The Iewes ſitting by the Riuers of Babel, wept: They could not ſing the Songs of the Lord in a
